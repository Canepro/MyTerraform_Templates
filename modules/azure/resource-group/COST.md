# Cost Information: Azure Resource Group

## Cost Category: **Always Free** ✅

Azure Resource Groups are completely free. There is no charge for creating, managing, or maintaining resource groups.

## Cost Breakdown

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Resource Group creation | $0.00 |
| Resource Group storage | $0.00 |
| Resource Group management | $0.00 |

## Important Notes

1. **Container Only**: Resource Groups are just containers for organizing Azure resources. They have no cost themselves.

2. **Resource Costs Apply**: You pay only for the resources you deploy **within** the resource group, not for the group itself.

3. **No Limits on Groups**: You can create up to 980 resource groups per subscription at no cost.

4. **Tags Are Free**: Applying tags to resource groups is free and doesn't incur any charges.

## Cost Safety for Sandbox/Development

✅ **100% Safe** - Use as many resource groups as needed for organization without any cost impact.

### Recommended Strategy

- Use separate resource groups for different environments (sandbox, dev, prod)
- Create resource groups per project or application
- Organize resources by lifecycle (deploy/delete together)
- No need to limit resource group creation for cost reasons

## Billing Insights

- Resource groups appear in Azure Cost Management for organizing costs
- Costs are attributed to resources within the group, not the group itself
- Use tags on resource groups to track costs across projects/teams
